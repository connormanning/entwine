Entwine's community interacts through `Gitter`_, `GitHub`_, and a `mailing list`_.  Please feel welcome to ask questions and participate in all of the venues.  The `Gitter`_ channels are for real-time chat activities.  The `GitHub`_ communication channel is for development activities, bug reports, and testing.  The `mailing list`_ communication channel is for general questions, development discussion, and feedback.  The mailing list and Gitter channels are shared with those of `PDAL`_.

Gitter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entwine developers and some users are active on `Gitter`_, which can be used for asking questions in a real-time chat.  Gitter uses your GitHub credentials for access, so you will need an account to get started.

GitHub

Visit http://github.com/connormanning/entwine to file issues you might be having with the software.  GitHub is also where you can obtain a current development version of the software in the `git`_ version control system.

Mailing List
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Developers and users of Entwine participate on the PDAL mailing list. It is OK to ask questions about how to use Entwine, how to integrate Entwine into your own software, and report issues that you might have.
