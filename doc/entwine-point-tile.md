# Entwine Point Tile

Entwine Point Tile (EPT) is a simple and flexible octree-based storage format for point cloud data.  This document is a working draft of the format.

TODO - add links to sample data.

## Metadata files

### entwine.json

The core metadata required to interpret the contents of an EPT dataset.  An example file might look like this:
```json
{
    "bounds": [634962.0, 848881.0, -1818.0, 639620.0, 853539.0, 2840.0],
    "boundsConforming": [635577.0, 848882.0, 406.0, 639004.0, 853538.0, 616.0],
    "dataType": "laszip",
    "hierarchyStep": 6,
    "hierarchyType": "json",
    "numPoints": 10653336,
    "offset": [637291.0, 851210.0, 511.0],
    "scale": 0.01,
    "schema": [
        { "name": "X", "type": "int32" },
        { "name": "Y", "type": "int32" },
        { "name": "Z", "type": "int32" },
        { "name": "Intensity", "type": "uint16" },
        { "name": "ReturnNumber", "type": "uint8" },
        { "name": "NumberOfReturns", "type": "uint8" },
        { "name": "ScanDirectionFlag", "type": "uint8" },
        { "name": "EdgeOfFlightLine", "type": "uint8" },
        { "name": "Classification", "type": "uint8" },
        { "name": "ScanAngleRank", "type": "float" },
        { "name": "UserData", "type": "uint8" },
        { "name": "PointSourceId", "type": "uint16" },
        { "name": "GpsTime", "type": "double" },
        { "name": "Red", "type": "uint16" },
        { "name": "Green", "type": "uint16" },
        { "name": "Blue", "type": "uint16" }
    ],
    "reprojection": { "out": "EPSG:3857" },
    "srs" : "EPSG:3857",
    "ticks" : 256
}
```

#### bounds
An array of 6 numbers of the format `[xmin, ymin, zmin, xmax, ymax, zmax]` describing the cubic bounds of the octree indexing structure.  This value is always in native coordinate space, so any `scale` or `offset` values will not have been applied.  This value is presented in the coordinate system matching the `srs` value.

#### boundsConforming
An array of 6 numbers of the format `[xmin, ymin, zmin, xmax, ymax, zmax]` describing the narrowest bounds conforming to the maximal extents of the data.  This value is always in native coordinate space, so any `scale` or `offset` values will not have been applied.  This value is presented in the coordinate system matching the `srs` value.

#### dataType
A string describing the binary format of the tiled point cloud data.  Possible values:

- `laszip`: Point cloud files are [LASzip](https://laszip.org/) compressed, with file extension `.laz`.
- `binary`: Point cloud files are stored as uncompressed binary data in the format matching the `schema`, with file extension `.bin`.

#### hierarchyStep
This value indicates the octree depth modulo at which the hierarchy storage is split up.  This value may not be present at all, which indicates that the hierarchy is stored contiguously without any splitting.  See the `Hierarchy` section.

#### hierarchyType
A string describing the hierarchy storage format.  See the `Hierarchy` section.  The hierarchy itself is always represented as JSON, but this value may indicate a compression method for this JSON.  Possible values:

- `json`: Hierarchy is stored uncompressed with file extension `.json`.
- `gzip`: Hierarchy is stored as [Gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/) compressed JSON with file extension `.json.gz`.

#### numPoints
A number indicating the total number of points indexed into this EPT dataset.

#### offset
The offset at which this data was indexed - an array of length 3.  This value will not exist for absolutely positioned data.  If `offset` is present, then absolutely positioned values for spatial coordinates can be determined as `absolutelyPositionedValue = serializedValue * scale + offset`.  Note that for a `dataType` of `laszip`, offset information must be read from the LAZ header since individual files may be serialized with a local offset.

#### reprojection
An optional value representing reprojection performed during the indexing step.  If present, this value is a JSON object with required string value `out`, representing the output spatial reference system.  Optional value `in` represents the input coordinate system used, which may be omitted if input coordinate systems are inferred from file headers.

#### scale
The scale factor for this data.  May be either a number, an array of length 3, or may not be present at all in the case of absolutely positioned data.  If `scale` is present, then absolutely positioned values for spatial coordinates can be determined as `absolutelyPositionedValue = serializedValue * scale + offset`.

#### schema
An array of objects that represent the indexed dimensions - every dimension has a `name` and a `type`.  Spatial coordinates with names `X`, `Y`, and `Z` will always be present as the first 3 values of this array.  Valid values for `type` are `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `float`, and `double`.

For a `dataType` of `binary`, the `schema` provides information on the binary contents of each file.  However for `laszip` data, the file should be parsed according to its header, as individual [LASzip formats](https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf) may combine dimension values.  For example, for point format IDs 0-4, `ReturnNumber`, `NumberOfReturns`, `ScanDirectionFlag`, and `EdgeOfFlightLine` dimensions are bit-packed into a single byte.

#### srs
A string describing the spatial reference system for this indexed dataset.  May be empty or missing if no output coordinate system was set and none could be inferred from the input data file headers.  If a `reprojection` is specified, then this value must match the value of `reprojection.out`.  All spatial information throughout all tileset metadata is presented in the coordinate system of this `srs`.

#### ticks
This value represents the number of ticks in one dimension for the grid size used for the octree.  For example, a `ticks` value of `256` means that the root volume of the octree is the `bounds` cube at a resolution of `256 * 256 * 256`.

For aerial LiDAR data which tends to be mostly flat in the Z-range, for example, this would loosely correspond to a practical resolution of `256 * 256` points per volume.  Each subsequent depth bisects this volume, leading to 8 sub-volumes with the same grid size, which corresponds to double the resolution in each dimension.

### entwine-files.json
TODO.  Describe the storage of the metadata for each input file.

### entwine-build.json
This file may be ignored by EPT reader clients, and is used to store builder-specific information which may be necessary specify parameters required to continue an existing build at a later time.

## Point cloud data
The point data itself is arranged in a 3D analogous manner to [slippy map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) tiling schemes.  The filename scheme `Zoom-X-Y` is expanded to three dimensions as `Depth-X-Y-Z`.  As opposed to raster tiling schemes where coarser-resolution data is replaced as its sub-tiles are traversed, the point cloud data is instead additive, meaning that full-resolution is obtained by the accumulated traversal from depth `0` to the last depth containing a positive point count for the selected area.

The root volume, is always named `0-0-0-0`.  This volume always represents the volume of the cubic `bounds` value from `entwine.json` split in each dimension by `ticks`.  So a `bounds` with a volume of 256 cubic meters, with a `ticks` value of `256`, corresponds to a root node with a maximum of 1 point per cubic meter.

Each node at depth `D` may have up to 8 child nodes at depth `D + 1` which represent bisected sub-volumes.  To zoom in, depth `D` is incremented by one, and each of `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are doubled and then possibly incremented by one.  Coordinates are treated as Cartesian during this bisection, so `X -> 2 * X` represents the sub-volume where the new maximum `X` value is the midpoint from its parent, and `X -> 2 * X + 1` represents the sub-volume where the new minimum `X` value is the midpoint from its parent.

In web-mercator, for example, where `X` increases going eastward and `Y` increases going northward, a traversal from `0-0-0-0` to `1-1-0-1` represents a traversal to the east/south/down sub-volume.

There is no fixed maximum resolution depth, instead the tiles must be traversed until no more data exists.  For look-ahead capability, see `Hierarchy`.

## Hierarchy
The hierarchy section contains information about what nodes exist and how many points they contain.  The file format is simple JSON object, with string keys of `D-X-Y-Z` mapping to a point count for the corresponding file.  The root file of the hierarchy data exists at `h/0-0-0-0.json`.  For example:
```json
{
    "0-0-0-0": 65341,
        "1-0-0-0": 438,
            "2-0-1-0": 322,
        "1-0-0-1": 56209,
            "2-0-1-2": 4332,
            "2-1-1-2": 20300,
            "2-1-1-3": 64020,
                "3-2-3-6": 32004,
                    "4-4-6-12": 1500,
                    "4-5-6-13": 2400,
                "3-3-3-7": 542,
        "1-0-1-0": 30390,
            "2-1-2-0": 2300,
        "1-1-1-1": 2303
}
```

Note that this sample is visually arranged hierarchically for clarity, which is not the case in practice.

Furthermore, if `entwine.json` contains a `hierarchyStep` key, then the hierarchy is split into multiple files whenever `D % hierarchyStep == 0`.  The next filename corresponds to the `D-X-Y-Z` value of the local root node at this depth.  The above example, with a `hierarchyStep` of `3`, would look like:

`h/0-0-0-0.json`
```json
{
    "0-0-0-0": 65341,
        "1-0-0-0": 438,
            "2-0-1-0": 322,
        "1-0-0-1": 56209,
            "2-0-1-2": 4332,
            "2-1-1-2": 20300,
            "2-1-1-3": 64020,
                "3-2-3-6": 32004,
                "3-3-3-7": 542,
        "1-0-1-0": 30390,
            "2-1-2-0": 2300,
        "1-1-1-1": 2303
}
```

`h/3-2-3-6.json`
```json
{
    "3-2-3-6": 32004,
        "4-4-6-12": 1500,
        "4-5-6-13": 2400
}
```

`h/3-3-3-7.json`
```json
{
    "3-3-3-7": 542
}
```

The local root node of each subfile is duplicated in its parent file so that child hierarchy files can be guaranteed to exist during traversal if their key exists in the parent file.
